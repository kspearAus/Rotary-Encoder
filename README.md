# Rotary-Encoder
Sketch that has been working for me.
Based on work from the following 
/* Gary's solution  https://garrysblog.com/2021/03/20/reliably-debouncing-rotary-encoders-with-arduino-and-esp32/#more-187
 *  Based on Oleg Mazurov's code for rotary encoder interrupt service routines for AVR micros
   here https://chome.nerpa.tech/mcu/reading-rotary-encoder-on-arduino/
   and using interrupts https://chome.nerpa.tech/mcu/rotary-encoder-interrupt-service-routine-for-avr-micros/
